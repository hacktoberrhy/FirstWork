### Structure

#### REGISTER AS PATIENT
The user enters name, blood group, date & time of blood requirement. A PHP file checks the available blood table to see if there is enough blood. It also checks if the doctor doesn’t have an existing appointment already at that date and time. If all checks are successful, the tables are updated and a new page comes up which asks for the patient details. On submitting this form, the patient table is updated. The appointment gets updated in appointment table

#### DOCTORS
The doctor enters login details which are checked in the doctor table. If entered correctly , a new page comes up showing the doctors previous , todays and upcoming appointments . These are three different pages . The doctor can sign out of his account . On clicking forgot password, the doctor id , new password ,security question and its answer is asked . The security question and answer is checked in the forgot table and the password is updated in the doctor table.
